J13 - Character Equalizer

This project was inspired by a video by Chris Lord-Alge talking about his namesake CLA plugins. He described their design as what he wanted for his personal workflow and then a few 'extras' added to make them more useful to others.

For the J13 Character Equalizer I wanted a tool that could do some of the most common types of EQ that I use and add a touch of saturation character into the sound. To make it more usefull I've added 'clean' modes to bypass the saturation.

This plugin is under active development, so use at own risk. This plugin is developed using the JUCE Framework (https://juce.com/). I'm developing and testing on Linux but it should work on all the common platforms that the framework supports.
